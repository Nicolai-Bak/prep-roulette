# PREP-ROULETTE
A small software product that helps you decide what to meal prep for the coming week, without repeating recent dishes or needing to remember past favourites.

## How it works

- Each week the system proposes two meal-prep recipes.

- You choose a third meal yourself, keeping some freedom and creativity.

- Over time, the app builds a personal recipe library based on what you’ve cooked.

- The planner avoids suggesting meals cooked in the last X weeks (configurable).
